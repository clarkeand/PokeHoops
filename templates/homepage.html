   <h2>Pok√©hoops is a NBA database that utilizes üèÄ NBA player stats to calculate a POKED (P.O.K.E.D. - Power, Offense, Kinetics, Endurance, Defense)
    score of every active (and teamed although there is a 'free agent team') NBA player. The inital project will include a searchable player database with team rosters, user login
    and a 'favorite player' button on each player's individual overview page. 
  
   In this initial version we will use season stats since we are in the offseason. </h2>
