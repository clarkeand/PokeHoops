  Pokéhoops is a NBA database that utilizes 🏀 NBA player stats to calculate a POKED (P.O.K.E.D. - Power, Offense, Kinetics, Endurance, Defense)
  score of every active (and teamed) NBA player. The inital project will include a searchable player database with team rosters, user login
  and a 'favorite player' button on each player's individual overview page. 

 In this inital version we will use season stats since we are in the offeseason.
