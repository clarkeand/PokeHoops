  Pok√©hoops is a NBA database that utilizes NBA player stats to calculate a POKED (P.O.K.E.D. - Power, Offense, Kinetics, Endurance, Defense)
  score of every active (and teamed) NBA player. The inital project will include a searchable player database with team rosters, user login
  and a 'favorite player' button on each player's individual overview page. 

  The idea is to one day add a fantasy style website where you can draft teams and have the POKED fluctuate game by game. In this inital version we will use season stats since we are in the offeseason.
